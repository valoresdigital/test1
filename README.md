### Task

The development team at Valores Digital has provided you with a snippet of code that retrieves a list of users who have been active the last week and display them in a list of items on the browser. Your task is to reorganize the code following programming principles and good practices. Don't forget to document the code! ;) ... whenever you find it useful.

Note: It is not demanding that the final code is a working code. This time we are focusing on the quality and cleanliness of the code. 

### Deliverables

Create a new branch and name it with your name. You will upload this branch only. Make sure to include all the additional files you may have created. 

### CodeSubmit

Once you're done with the task and you have organized your code, push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,

The Valores Digital Team
